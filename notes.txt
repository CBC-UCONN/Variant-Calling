Variant calling tutorial notes:


BQSR?
VQSR?

should do QC/alignment 2x. first piecewise, then piping steps together. 

GATK and FB should proceed from the same alignment set instead of duplicating effort.


in actual text of tutorials should some things be shown? Or only displayed in terminal?

	show help output from running, e.g. `freebayes` with no input?
	show lines from files, e.g. samfile? fastq?

SCRIPTS:
	check to ensure that slurm resource requests == process needs in each script. 
	check to ensure --job-name= is correct

where will reference genome/indexes reside?

add section in part 1 on IGV.

edit to keep "introduction" very short. add a "motivation" section after the table of contents to cover more background.
