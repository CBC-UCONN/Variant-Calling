Variant calling tutorial notes:

need to figure out which data to use. 

	coverage should be higher. 

	should use same data across all tutorials. 

	should use multiple samples. 

should cover variant filtering steps better. 

BQSR?
VQSR?

should do QC/alignment 2x. first piecewise, then piping steps together. 

GATK and FB should proceed from the same alignment set instead of duplicating effort.
