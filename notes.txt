Variant calling tutorial notes:


BQSR?
VQSR?

GATK and FB should proceed from the same alignment set instead of duplicating effort.


in actual text of tutorials should some things be shown? Or only displayed in terminal?

	show help output from running, e.g. `freebayes` with no input?
	show lines from files, e.g. samfile? fastq?

SCRIPTS:
	check to ensure that slurm resource requests == process needs in each script. 
	check to ensure --job-name= is correct

where will reference genome/indexes reside?

add section in part 1 on IGV. 

Add note on license for distribution

edit to keep "introduction" very short. add a "motivation" section after the table of contents to cover more background. 
	- done, but motivation sections are not all written. 
	- motivation sections could include a flow chart? 

consider making parts 1 and 3 completely independent. 

add flow chart(s) to readme.md that can be revisited in subsequent sections

make or add figures to explain freebayes, gatk. 

asking for more resources for align script (12 procs instead of 4) to try to get all three alignments done quicker. check to see if typical workshop size + teaching partition can support this. 
	tried this. bwa does not like to run as a background process? tried two instances. one didn't use any processor. 


## 19.09.06
	checked parts 1,2,3. all scripts run fine. 
	alignment may take too long. consider trimming focal region to 2-3mb instead of 5?
		in piped example, son takes 10min, mom and dad 18 min each. 
		need to time the other scripts.
