# Variant discovery tutorials

In this repository, re-working variant detection tutorials for UConn CBC workshop. 

_Proposed structure:_

1. Stepwise QC, alignment, post-alignment processing. 

2. Variant Calling: samtools mpileup. 

3. Part 1, but a piped example. 

4. 
	a. Variant calling: Freebayes, post-filtering. 

	b. Variant calling: GATK, joint calling using gvcf. post-filtering. 

	c. Beyond variant calling: genotype likelihoods. (depending on audience?)

5. Variant annotation. 

_Proposed data:_

NIST Genome in a Bottle asian trio. chr20:10000000-15000000
