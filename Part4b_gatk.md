# Variant discovery using GATK

## Introduction


Steps here will use the following software packages:

- [ GATK ](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)
- [ bgzip ](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bgzip.html)
- [ tabix ](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html)

Each major step below has an associated bash script tailored to the UConn CBC Xanadu cluster with appropriate headers for the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job scheduler. The code can easily be modified to run interactively, or in other contexts.

## Motivation


## Update your working directory


## Generate single sample GVCF files


## Do joint variant calling on the GVCFs
